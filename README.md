## ◽ Data Acquisition
### ▫️ REST API
- **REST**, referring to *Representational State Transfer*, is a set of guidelines for structuring urls. Often times you will encounter the phrase RESTful to describe web sites or web services that follow **REST** guidelines.

    [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
    
- **API** stands for *Application Programming Interface*. It is a way that either developers interact with a program, or one program interacts with another.

- **JSON** stands for *JavaScript Object Notation*. All JSON is technically valid JavaScript code; JSON is very commonly used as a data representation format, and is commonly used as a data interchange format. In fact, if you were to open up a jupyter notebook in a plain text editor, you would see a big JSON object. JSON data structures consist of arrays (analogous to lists in python), objects (dictionaries), strings, booleans, and numbers.

### ▫️ `dt`
The `.dt` accessor can be used to access various properties of a date. Some of the more common ones are listed here, and you can reference the pandas documentation for a full list.

| **Property**   | **Description**   | 
|:--------|:------------|
| year | The year of the datetime |
| month | The month of the datetime |
| day | The days of the datetime | 
| hour | The hour of the datetime | 
| week | The week ordinal of the year |
| weekday | The number of the day of the week with Monday=0, Sunday=6 |
| weekday_name | The name of the day in a week (ex: Friday) |
| quarter | Quarter of the date: Jan-Mar = 1, Apr-Jun = 2, etc.

###  ▫️ `strfrtime`
`strftime` method and give date string to format the date in a custom way.

## ◽ Data Preparation
### ▫️ Prepare
- The most common activity in preparing time series data is setting dates to datetime types using `pd.to_datetime`.

- Another common activity is looking at the frequency of the data and gaps in time or null values.

### ▫️ Data Splitting
Splitting time series data into train, test, and validate sets is a little trickier than with previous data we have looked at. Because the data points have an order to them, we **cannot** simply assign each point randomly to train, validate, or test.

Ideally all splits should contain one season's worth of data. There are several methods we can use to split our time series data:

- **Human-based**: use, for example, the last year in the dataset as test split

- **Percentage based**: use the last 20% as test

- **Cross Validate**: break data up into slices and use successive slices as train and test repeatedly (`sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit`)

## ◽ Exploratory Analysis
The primary use case for Time Series EDA techniques is when we have a single continuous variable sampled over time and we want to identify **trend** and **seasonality**.
